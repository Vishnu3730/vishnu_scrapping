Israel-Hamas war: In late 2023, the Israel-Hamas conflict unfolded, with Hamas launching an attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, resulting in approximately 1,200 casualties and 240 hostages. In
response, Israel carried out airstrikes and a ground offensive in Gaza, leading to over 15,000 deaths by late November, as reported by Gaza authorities. Notably, many victims were children and young
individuals.
India’s lofty space ambitions: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) created history following the successful soft landing of its ambitious Chandrayaan-3 mission on the lunar south pole.
Chandrayaan-3 marked India's third lunar mission and its second endeavor to achieve a soft landing on the moon. India became the fourth nation after Russia, the US, and China to achieve a soft
landing, even as it became the first to do so at the unexplored south pole. ISRO successfully deployed the Vikram lander on the lunar surface and introduced the robotic rover, Pragyaan.
The success of G20 Presidency: In what has been termed India’s diplomatic achievement of 2023, the nation was able to get major countries together on the table and reach a consensus under its G20
Presidency. The 18th G20 Leaders' Summit was held in New Delhi on September 9 and 10. It saw the unanimous adoption of the G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration, which demonstrated the commitment of the
G20 leaders to address global challenges in an inclusive, decisive and action-oriented manner. Indian leaders also championed the cause of the Global South in the international discourse.
Khalistan back in focus: 2023 emerged as a significant year for Khalistani separatists in India and overseas. The 30-year-old preacher Amritpal Singh, who sought the establishment of Khalistan, was
arrested earlier in 2023. His supporters even attacked a police station to free one of their detained accomplices. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised eyebrows globally after he publicly
accused Indian government agents' involvement in the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Trudeau alleged that Indian agents were behind the assassination within Canada, a
claim India vehemently denied. A few months later, India was warned off again, this time by the United States of America for their alleged involvement in the foiled plot to kill another Khalistani
seperatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. On December 7, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said in Parliament that India has instituted an inquiry committee to look into the inputs received from the US
in the case as the matter has a bearing on national security
Wrestlers’ grapple for justice: India’s wrestlers, including those who won Olympic medals for the nation, hit the streets alleging sexual harassment by former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief
Brij Bhushan Singh. Singh also happened to be an MP representing the Bharatiya Janata Party. United World Wrestling (UWW), the sport's global governing body, suspended the WFI after the scandal. In
June, he was charged for allegedly sexually harassing six female wrestlers. He was later stripped of administrative powers by the sports ministry. The Central government pledged to investigate the
allegations and protect female athletes. In December, Sanjay Singh, a Brij Bhushan loyalist swept back to power, to the dismay of protesting wrestlers. This prompted Bajrang Punia, who was also the
first Indian wrestler to win four world championship medals, to return the Padma Shri
Congress' resurgence, only almost: The grand old party has remained in the Opposition at the Centre since 2014 when the BJP under Narendra Modi and Amit Shah swept to power. Yet, ahead of the 2024
General Elections, it got a boost when it claimed the throne in Karnataka. That was shortlived as the BJP won with a convincing majority in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in the assembly
elections, even as Congress won the battle in Telangana. The Opposition parties’ bid to reclaim power in the Centre saw the emergence of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA)
bloc of parties, termed ‘ghamandia’ alliance by the Prime Minister.
Manipur horrors: The world watched on in horror as violence ensued in the North Eastern state after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts of the state to protest against the
Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. The ethnic turmoil in Manipur created a significant upheaval within the ruling BJP as seven of its MLAs not only advocated for 'separate
administrations' (equivalent to a separate state) for the tribals but also called for Chief Minister N Biren Singh's resignation, criticizing BJP leaders for the current unrest.
Disaster in Odisha: An electronic signaling error in Odisha resulted in a train collision that claimed the lives of 275 individuals and left 1,175 others injured leading to India's biggest rail
tragedy. A computer malfunction misdirected one of the trains onto the wrong track, leading to a collision with a goods train. Eventually, 10 to 12 coaches of the passenger train derailed, causing
debris on the tracks that resulted in the derailment of three coaches of another passenger train traveling from the opposite direction. India's railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said: "Who has done
it and what is the reason will come out during an investigation."
World Cup shambles: India hosted the ICC Men’s ODI World Cup for the first time since 2011, and saw the Australians take the trophy home despite performing exceptionally well throughout the
tournament. It was dismay for skipper Rohit Sharma and his team as the Aussies under Pat Cummins outclassed the Indians in the final at Gujarat’s Narendra Modi stadium.In what could be termed as a
consolation, the Indian team performed at the top level at every game in the tournament (almost), excelling in all departments consistently (only almost).
India’s take on same-sex marriage: Even as it voiced its sympathy, the Supreme Court in October rejected pleas to legalize same-sex marriage in the country. “The right to choose one’s partner and the
right to recognition of that union” ought to be observed, even if the union does not constitute marriage, Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud, India’s chief justice, wrote in his verdict. The CJI
concurred with all the other justices that the court was the wrong forum for seeking changes in marriage laws, writing that the judiciary “must be careful to not enter into legislative domain.”
Parliament security breach: The Winter Session, held at the new Parliament complex, was marred by the security breach by four individuals. The Opposition sought answers from the Central government via
protests at the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and as many as 143 Parliamentarians were suspended for ‘creating a ruckus’. The ruling party accused the Opposition of showing a lack of respect when a
Trinamool Congress representative mimicked Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar in the Upper House. The Opposition also criticised the passing of what they termed as ‘draconian’ bills as the MPs were
suspended. Home Minister Amit Shah replaced India’s colonial era-criminal laws with new legislation that are made for India, and not for the ‘Crown.’
Earthquakes shake humanity: In February, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale struck Turkey and Syria, causing structures to collapse, seeing over 54,000 casualties in the catastrophe. In
September, another earthquake in Morocco claimed the lives of more than 2,900 individuals.
Israel-Hamas war: In late 2023, the Israel-Hamas conflict unfolded, with Hamas launching an attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, resulting in approximately 1,200 casualties and 240 hostages. In

Earthquakes shake humanity: In February, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale struck Turkey and Syria, causing structures to collapse, seeing over 54,000 casualties in the catastrophe. In
September, another earthquake in Morocco claimed the lives of more than 2,900 individuals.
Israel-Hamas war: In late 2023, the Israel-Hamas conflict unfolded, with Hamas launching an attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, resulting in approximately 1,200 casualties and 240 hostages. In
response, Israel carried out airstrikes and a ground offensive in Gaza, leading to over 15,000 deaths by late November, as reported by Gaza authorities. Notably, many victims were children and young
individuals.
India’s lofty space ambitions: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) created history following the successful soft landing of its ambitious Chandrayaan-3 mission on the lunar south pole.
Chandrayaan-3 marked India's third lunar mission and its second endeavor to achieve a soft landing on the moon. India became the fourth nation after Russia, the US, and China to achieve a soft
landing, even as it became the first to do so at the unexplored south pole. ISRO successfully deployed the Vikram lander on the lunar surface and introduced the robotic rover, Pragyaan.

The success of G20 Presidency: In what has been termed India’s diplomatic achievement of 2023, the nation was able to get major countries together on the table and reach a consensus under its G20
Presidency. The 18th G20 Leaders' Summit was held in New Delhi on September 9 and 10. It saw the unanimous adoption of the G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration, which demonstrated the commitment of the
G20 leaders to address global challenges in an inclusive, decisive and action-oriented manner. Indian leaders also championed the cause of the Global South in the international discourse.

Khalistan back in focus: 2023 emerged as a significant year for Khalistani separatists in India and overseas. The 30-year-old preacher Amritpal Singh, who sought the establishment of Khalistan, was
arrested earlier in 2023. His supporters even attacked a police station to free one of their detained accomplices. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised eyebrows globally after he publicly
accused Indian government agents' involvement in the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Trudeau alleged that Indian agents were behind the assassination within Canada, a
claim India vehemently denied. A few months later, India was warned off again, this time by the United States of America for their alleged involvement in the foiled plot to kill another Khalistani
seperatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. On December 7, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said in Parliament that India has instituted an inquiry committee to look into the inputs received from the US
in the case as the matter has a bearing on national security

Wrestlers’ grapple for justice: India’s wrestlers, including those who won Olympic medals for the nation, hit the streets alleging sexual harassment by former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief
Brij Bhushan Singh. Singh also happened to be an MP representing the Bharatiya Janata Party. United World Wrestling (UWW), the sport's global governing body, suspended the WFI after the scandal. In
June, he was charged for allegedly sexually harassing six female wrestlers. He was later stripped of administrative powers by the sports ministry. The Central government pledged to investigate the
allegations and protect female athletes. In December, Sanjay Singh, a Brij Bhushan loyalist swept back to power, to the dismay of protesting wrestlers. This prompted Bajrang Punia, who was also the
first Indian wrestler to win four world championship medals, to return the Padma Shri

Congress' resurgence, only almost: The grand old party has remained in the Opposition at the Centre since 2014 when the BJP under Narendra Modi and Amit Shah swept to power. Yet, ahead of the 2024
General Elections, it got a boost when it claimed the throne in Karnataka. That was shortlived as the BJP won with a convincing majority in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in the assembly
elections, even as Congress won the battle in Telangana. The Opposition parties’ bid to reclaim power in the Centre saw the emergence of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA)
bloc of parties, termed ‘ghamandia’ alliance by the Prime Minister.

Manipur horrors: The world watched on in horror as violence ensued in the North Eastern state after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts of the state to protest against the
Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. The ethnic turmoil in Manipur created a significant upheaval within the ruling BJP as seven of its MLAs not only advocated for 'separate
administrations' (equivalent to a separate state) for the tribals but also called for Chief Minister N Biren Singh's resignation, criticizing BJP leaders for the current unrest.

Disaster in Odisha: An electronic signaling error in Odisha resulted in a train collision that claimed the lives of 275 individuals and left 1,175 others injured leading to India's biggest rail
tragedy. A computer malfunction misdirected one of the trains onto the wrong track, leading to a collision with a goods train. Eventually, 10 to 12 coaches of the passenger train derailed, causing
debris on the tracks that resulted in the derailment of three coaches of another passenger train traveling from the opposite direction. India's railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said: "Who has done
it and what is the reason will come out during an investigation."

World Cup shambles: India hosted the ICC Men’s ODI World Cup for the first time since 2011, and saw the Australians take the trophy home despite performing exceptionally well throughout the
tournament. It was dismay for skipper Rohit Sharma and his team as the Aussies under Pat Cummins outclassed the Indians in the final at Gujarat’s Narendra Modi stadium.In what could be termed as a
consolation, the Indian team performed at the top level at every game in the tournament (almost), excelling in all departments consistently (only almost).

India’s take on same-sex marriage: Even as it voiced its sympathy, the Supreme Court in October rejected pleas to legalize same-sex marriage in the country. “The right to choose one’s partner and the
right to recognition of that union” ought to be observed, even if the union does not constitute marriage, Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud, India’s chief justice, wrote in his verdict. The CJI
concurred with all the other justices that the court was the wrong forum for seeking changes in marriage laws, writing that the judiciary “must be careful to not enter into legislative domain.”

Parliament security breach: The Winter Session, held at the new Parliament complex, was marred by the security breach by four individuals. The Opposition sought answers from the Central government via
protests at the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and as many as 143 Parliamentarians were suspended for ‘creating a ruckus’. The ruling party accused the Opposition of showing a lack of respect when a
Trinamool Congress representative mimicked Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar in the Upper House. The Opposition also criticised the passing of what they termed as ‘draconian’ bills as the MPs were
suspended. Home Minister Amit Shah replaced India’s colonial era-criminal laws with new legislation that are made for India, and not for the ‘Crown.’

India’s take on same-sex marriage: Even as it voiced its sympathy, the Supreme Court in October rejected pleas to legalize same-sex marriage in the country. “The right to choose one’s partner and the
right to recognition of that union” ought to be observed, even if the union does not constitute marriage, Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud, India’s chief justice, wrote in his verdict. The CJI
concurred with all the other justices that the court was the wrong forum for seeking changes in marriage laws, writing that the judiciary “must be careful to not enter into legislative domain.”
Parliament security breach: The Winter Session, held at the new Parliament complex, was marred by the security breach by four individuals. The Opposition sought answers from the Central government via
protests at the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and as many as 143 Parliamentarians were suspended for ‘creating a ruckus’. The ruling party accused the Opposition of showing a lack of respect when a
Trinamool Congress representative mimicked Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar in the Upper House. The Opposition also criticised the passing of what they termed as ‘draconian’ bills as the MPs were
suspended. Home Minister Amit Shah replaced India’s colonial era-criminal laws with new legislation that are made for India, and not for the ‘Crown.’
Earthquakes shake humanity: In February, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale struck Turkey and Syria, causing structures to collapse, seeing over 54,000 casualties in the catastrophe. In
September, another earthquake in Morocco claimed the lives of more than 2,900 individuals.
Israel-Hamas war: In late 2023, the Israel-Hamas conflict unfolded, with Hamas launching an attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, resulting in approximately 1,200 casualties and 240 hostages. In
response, Israel carried out airstrikes and a ground offensive in Gaza, leading to over 15,000 deaths by late November, as reported by Gaza authorities. Notably, many victims were children and young
individuals.

India’s lofty space ambitions: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) created history following the successful soft landing of its ambitious Chandrayaan-3 mission on the lunar south pole.
Chandrayaan-3 marked India's third lunar mission and its second endeavor to achieve a soft landing on the moon. India became the fourth nation after Russia, the US, and China to achieve a soft
landing, even as it became the first to do so at the unexplored south pole. ISRO successfully deployed the Vikram lander on the lunar surface and introduced the robotic rover, Pragyaan.
The success of G20 Presidency: In what has been termed India’s diplomatic achievement of 2023, the nation was able to get major countries together on the table and reach a consensus under its G20
Presidency. The 18th G20 Leaders' Summit was held in New Delhi on September 9 and 10. It saw the unanimous adoption of the G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration, which demonstrated the commitment of the
G20 leaders to address global challenges in an inclusive, decisive and action-oriented manner. Indian leaders also championed the cause of the Global South in the international discourse.
Khalistan back in focus: 2023 emerged as a significant year for Khalistani separatists in India and overseas. The 30-year-old preacher Amritpal Singh, who sought the establishment of Khalistan, was
arrested earlier in 2023. His supporters even attacked a police station to free one of their detained accomplices. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised eyebrows globally after he publicly
accused Indian government agents' involvement in the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Trudeau alleged that Indian agents were behind the assassination within Canada, a
claim India vehemently denied. A few months later, India was warned off again, this time by the United States of America for their alleged involvement in the foiled plot to kill another Khalistani
seperatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. On December 7, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said in Parliament that India has instituted an inquiry committee to look into the inputs received from the US
in the case as the matter has a bearing on national security
Wrestlers’ grapple for justice: India’s wrestlers, including those who won Olympic medals for the nation, hit the streets alleging sexual harassment by former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief
Brij Bhushan Singh. Singh also happened to be an MP representing the Bharatiya Janata Party. United World Wrestling (UWW), the sport's global governing body, suspended the WFI after the scandal. In
June, he was charged for allegedly sexually harassing six female wrestlers. He was later stripped of administrative powers by the sports ministry. The Central government pledged to investigate the
allegations and protect female athletes. In December, Sanjay Singh, a Brij Bhushan loyalist swept back to power, to the dismay of protesting wrestlers. This prompted Bajrang Punia, who was also the
first Indian wrestler to win four world championship medals, to return the Padma Shri
Congress' resurgence, only almost: The grand old party has remained in the Opposition at the Centre since 2014 when the BJP under Narendra Modi and Amit Shah swept to power. Yet, ahead of the 2024
General Elections, it got a boost when it claimed the throne in Karnataka. That was shortlived as the BJP won with a convincing majority in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in the assembly
elections, even as Congress won the battle in Telangana. The Opposition parties’ bid to reclaim power in the Centre saw the emergence of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA)
bloc of parties, termed ‘ghamandia’ alliance by the Prime Minister.
Manipur horrors: The world watched on in horror as violence ensued in the North Eastern state after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts of the state to protest against the
Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. The ethnic turmoil in Manipur created a significant upheaval within the ruling BJP as seven of its MLAs not only advocated for 'separate
administrations' (equivalent to a separate state) for the tribals but also called for Chief Minister N Biren Singh's resignation, criticizing BJP leaders for the current unrest.
Disaster in Odisha: An electronic signaling error in Odisha resulted in a train collision that claimed the lives of 275 individuals and left 1,175 others injured leading to India's biggest rail
tragedy. A computer malfunction misdirected one of the trains onto the wrong track, leading to a collision with a goods train. Eventually, 10 to 12 coaches of the passenger train derailed, causing
debris on the tracks that resulted in the derailment of three coaches of another passenger train traveling from the opposite direction. India's railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said: "Who has done
it and what is the reason will come out during an investigation."
World Cup shambles: India hosted the ICC Men’s ODI World Cup for the first time since 2011, and saw the Australians take the trophy home despite performing exceptionally well throughout the
tournament. It was dismay for skipper Rohit Sharma and his team as the Aussies under Pat Cummins outclassed the Indians in the final at Gujarat’s Narendra Modi stadium.In what could be termed as a
consolation, the Indian team performed at the top level at every game in the tournament (almost), excelling in all departments consistently (only almost).
